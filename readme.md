## Installing

1. Obtain a copy of this repository on your device.
   
   If you have git installed: `git clone https://github.com/pythonmcpi/moonuino_lib`

   Otherwise, click the "Code" dropdown (green button) and select "Download ZIP". Unzip the downloaded file.

2. Locate your sketchbook folder. The location can be found in Arduino IDE at File > Preferences > Sketchbook location. The default location on Windows is `C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Documents\Arduino`.

3. Then, locate the `libraries` folder inside your sketchbook folder and enter it.

4. Copy the `Moonunio` folder from the download to your `libraries` folder in the sketchbook. Check that `Moonuino.cpp` and `Moonunio.h` are directly inside that folder. If the folder you copied includes `readme.md` and `example.ino`, you copied the wrong folder.
